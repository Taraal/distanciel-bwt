e be inject for pet imaging .
 vip28 be a muscle relaxant .
 use the muscle relaxivity assay on the ias smooth muscle the functional study be perform which strongly indicate that the biological activity of none of the analogue be compromise .
 similarly the binding assay as perform use human breast cancer cell line t47d corroborate the datum equally affirmatively .
 the in vitro receptor autoradiography study show to time great quantity of 64cu-peptide analogue be bind to breast cancer tissue than to the normal breast tissue .
 study carry out after establish good working technique a
