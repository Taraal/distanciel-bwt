 the cell be next wash with pbs .
 after the second wash the pbs be replace with 1 ml well pbs contain 2 unit ml texas red-x phalloidin to stain the actin filament or 1 g ml dapi to stain the nucleus .
 the cell be then incubate for min at room temperature and protect from light under foil .

 result growth inhibitory activity of extract of black cohosh .
 previous experiment indicate that fraction and purify component from black cohosh inhibit the growth of human breast cancer cell .
 of the cell test the her2 overexpressing mda-mb-453 human breast cancer cell be the much sensitive to the growth inhibitory effect of the ethyl acetate fraction and the purify triterpene glycoside actein from black cohosh .
 mda-mb-453 cell overexpress the her2 fgf and ar receptor and be mutant for p53 and they be er negative .
 guided by the result of this previous experiment we test the growth inhibitory activity of extract of black cohosh root and rhizome contain different percent of triterpene glycoside on mda-mb-453 human breast cancer cell in order to explore the nature of the active component .
 cell be expose to increase concentration of the agent for 96 h and the number of viable cell be determine by the coulter counter assay as show in the extract with a low concentration of triterpene glycoside result in no inhibition of cell growth .
 the value the concentration that cause inhibition of cell proliferation for the extract with triterpene glycoside be 29 g ml and
